A collection of 320 Tang Dynasty poems compiled into this beautiful API (Originally compiled as "300 Tang Poems" (Zhu, 1763))


Documentation for the API @ https://merol-api.herokuapp.com/docs
Main API homepage @ https://merol-api.herokuapp.com


Future plans:
- Perhaps generate an SSL key for this if the need arises (or if I just would like to learn about data encryption and TLS)

In a future API I'll implement POST and DELETE requests, but it isn't compatible with this API as the number and content of poems remains fixated


Have a nice day :)
