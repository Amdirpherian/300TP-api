A collection of 320 Tang Dynasty poems compiled into this beautiful API (Originally compiled as "300 Tang Poems" (Zhu, 1763)) V6


Documentation for the API @ https://api-300tp.herokuapp.com/docs
Main API homepage @ https://api-300tp.herokuapp.com


Future plans:
- Turn it into a library with PyPi

In a future API I'll implement POST and DELETE requests, but it isn't compatible with this API as the number and content of poems remains fixated


Have a nice day :)
